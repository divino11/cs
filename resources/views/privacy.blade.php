    <h2 class="text-center">Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h5 class="text-center">Effective Date: 3/24/2019</h5>
    <p>Certain capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning assigned to them in our Terms and Conditions.</p>
    <h5>HOW THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT IS USED</h5>
    <p>The information we collect is used to provide the products and services that you have requested and may be used to provide you information that we think you might have an interest in through marketing outreach to you directly or indirectly. It is also used to improve the content of our Website and the products and services that we offer.</p>

    <h5>HOW THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT IS SHARED</h5>
    <p>We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.</p>

    <p>In order to operate our Website and in order to provide you with the products and services you have requested, we occasionally need to share information with third parties. We may transmit your information to service providers who may assist us with services such as processing orders, shipping products to you and processing your payment information. In addition, service providers help us with the services described in greater detail below. Their only role is to help us conduct our business. They are not permitted to use your information for any secondary purpose.</p>

    <p>We use software tools and service providers to help us gather and analyze information about our customers on our web site. By reporting and tracking ads served on our Website and providing additional information about our customers, these service providers help us conduct our business, optimize our ad campaigns, and deliver the most relevant products and services.</p>

    <p>If required by law, we may provide any and all information we have about you to law enforcement or other government agencies, pursuant to a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, warrant, or other order by a court of competent jurisdiction or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. In all cases, we will require written documentation of the request, proof of the identity of the law enforcement official making the request, and we will take steps to authenticate the validity of the request. Any law enforcement or government agency request submitted with less than a court-issued order will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the need and urgency, as well as the particular law enforcement agency making the request.</p>

    <h5>THE CHOICES REGARDING THE INFORMATION YOU COLLECT</h5>
    <p>If you do not want to receive email from us, please let us know by calling, sending us an email, opting out by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email you received from us or by writing to us at the above postal address and telling us that you do not want to receive email from our company.</p>

If you do not want to receive those kinds of advertisements more generally, look for the "Ad Choices" icon in the advertisements, which will contain a link to the privacy policy of the ad network that will provide you with information on how to opt-out of receiving such targeted advertising.</p>

    <p>If you choose to opt-out out of our use of your information for direct marketing purposes, this does not remove your information from our data database entirely. We will retain your information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. In addition, if you include your email in an order, you will continue to receive transactional messaging about your order status.</p>

If your information changes, you may correct or update the information by making the changes on our member information page. For security reasons, however, some parts of your information may not be changed online and may require you to call or write to us in order to verify your identity before such changes can be made. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. To request that we no longer use your information to provide our services, the removal of your testimonial, or the removal of your information from a blog or public forum, please contact us via email.</p>

If you become aware of any information we have collected from children under 13, please contact us as provided below.</p>

    <h5>RIGHT TO REMOVAL OF POSTED INFORMATION - CALIFORNIA MINORS</h5>
    <p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Us, you have the right to request removal of unwanted information that you publicly post on the Tech Resources.

Upon receiving such a request, We make sure that the information is not publicly available on the Tech Resources, but the information may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems and databases.</p>
