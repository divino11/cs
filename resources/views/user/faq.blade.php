                                millionaire, just a
                                guy that loves Bitcoin and was disappointed with other alert systems. I don't have a

                                it's just me.&nbsp;Iâ€™ll get back to you just as soon as I can.&nbsp; Thank you for your

                                <p>Simple Example. Price was $10 and is now $15. This is a 50% increase.</p>
                                <p>(($15 - 10) / $10) * 100 = 50</p>

                                <p>Example - if you set an alert to monitor a 2% increase in the buy price within 1 day
                                    everytime we
                                    check the market you've selected we will then compare it with the data we have from
                                    exactly 24
                                    hours previous.</p>
